The aim of this project is to create a game without screen allowing to kids to understand computing logic.
To do that, I've think to a computed music box. 
Using paper sheet with whole you can create music (Do, RÃ©, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si) or with Uk notation (C, D, E, F, G, L, B)

Example : 
+------+------+------+------+------+

|   +-----+   |  +------+   |      |  C
|   |  |  |   |  |   |  |   |      |
|   |  |  |   |  |   |  |   |      |
|   +-----+   |  +------+   |      |
|      |      |      |      |      |
|      |    +---+    |      |      |
|      |    | | |    |      |      |  D
|      |    | | |    |      |      |
|      |    +---+    |      |      |
