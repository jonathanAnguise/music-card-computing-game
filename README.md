# music_card_computing_game
musical toy

The aim of this project is to create a game without screen allowing to kids to understand computing logic.
To do that, I've think to a computed music box. 
Using paper sheet with whole you can create music (Do, Ré, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si) or with Uk notation (C, D, E, F, G, L, B)

Example : 
+------+------+------+------+------+
|      |      |      |      |      |
|   +-----+   |  +------+   |      |  C
|   |  |  |   |  |   |  |   |      |
|   |  |  |   |  |   |  |   |      |
|   +-----+   |  +------+   |      |
|      |      |      |      |      |
|      |    +---+    |      |      |
|      |    | | |    |      |      |  D
|      |    | | |    |      |      |
|      |    +---+    |      |      |
|      |      |      |      |      |
